Octo-Bar
========

Octo-Bar is where I will keep track of the current bar stock.  The plan is to provide some notes for each spirit and perhaps give you an idea of why it ended up on our shelf.  In time, I'd also like to start posting up opportunities for in-house tastings, educational events, and off-site distillery tours.

Have any issues with the bar, or would you like to see anything in particular in the bar?  holler!
