For you Gin Tonic maniacs out there, I've brought in pretty much every Tonic syrup I could find locally.  I tried them all and picked out my favorites...why don't you sample them and tell me which one you like best?

**Small Hand Foods** - The local favorite from Jenn Colliau.  She already makes the best Grenadine and Orgeat on the market...but how does the tonic stand up?

**C&B's Old Fashioned** - Erin Cochran of Heirloom Cafe and Stephanie Bruce have been making this tonic for just a little over a year.

**Bradley's Kina Tonic** - Also about a year old, this tonic comes out of Seattle.  From Kickstarter to our bar.

**Jack Rudy Cocktail Co.** - This one calls Charleston, SC home and has been available a bit longer than the other tonics.  From Brooks Reitz, manager of FIG restaurant in Charleston, this tonic was inspired by his grandfather.

**5x5 Tonic** - Another, kickstarter-to-our-bar pick, this tonic comes from a trained herbalist in Chico.

Usage varies from .5oz for small hand all the way to 1oz for the 5x5, so see what works for you!
