Currently on Tap we've got three IPAs and one slightly mysterious Doppelbock.  I say slightly mysterious because the keg is mostly unmarked.  However after doing some detective work, I've got a pretty good idea of what's inside...

And while we might have 3 IPAs...there's quite a range between them, so hopefuly we can cover whatever mood you're in.

###Faction Spring IPA
Coming out of Alemeda's Faction Brewing, Husband and Wife brewers Rodger Davis and Claudia Pamparana focus on traditional styles with subtle twists.  They're not big on added aromatics, and tend towards softer hoppiness.  

The Spring IPA comes across on the lighter side, medium fruit, with sweet grain on the palate, mild hoppy bitterness on the finish.  For this release they're showcasing the use of freshly pelletized hops.


**American IPA 6.80% ABV**

###Coronado Hibiscus IPA
Brothers Ron and Rick Chapman make this beer in Coronado, CA.  They've been gaining renown for their balanced use of aromatics, so while you might shy away from "flavored" beers, they definitely utilize the additional flavors as seasoning rather than hitting you over the head with them.  They recently won "Best Medium-Sized Brewing Company" at the 2014 World Beer Cup.  They also recently collaborated with Coedo Brewery in Japan on a beer called Coedonado!


The Coronado Hibiscus IPA comes across soft on the nose, but on the palate has more vegetal notes, higher acidity too, so the Hibiscus is definitely there, but medium bodied. The finish is clean and dissapates quickly.  Should be a great food beer.


**American IPA 4.90% ABV**	

###El Segundo White Dog IPA
Named after the owner/brewer Rob Croxall's dog, The White Dog uses 50% Wheat, but doesn't come across like most wheated beers.  This lightens the brew and highlights West Coast and New Zealand Hops.  El Segundo carries the hop flag for LA's South Bay.


The El Sugundo White Dog IPA is sweetly hoppy on the nose and hits the palate with more coffee/toffee notes.  Light-Medium bodied, the finish sticks on the mid-palate with a soft bitterness.  This is the beer for the hop-hunter.


**American IPA 6.70%ABV, 53 IBU, 5 SRM**

###Schloss Eggenberg Samichlaus Doppelbock
This is the mystery keg. The only markings on it are from the US importer and "Raderberger Group KG."  When I tapped it and tasted it my first thought was "Delicious, but this isn't Raderberger at all!" And so I just had to figure out what the hell we had.

Castle Eggenberg is one of Europe's oldest breweries, making its home in the north of the Alps since the 10th century.  This family operation is now on its seventh generation.  Samichlaus is brewed only once a year on December 6th, and is then aged for 10 months.

Samichlaus is all caramel and strawberry candy with a light char to keep things interesting.  Really nicely aromatic, and big ripe stone fruit on the tongue. Like a port, but softer. Sweetness and light bitterness lingers for quite some time on the finish. Might be too sweet if you think of it in terms of beer, but if you think of it like an after dinner drink, it's pretty bomb.  DANGER does not feel like 14% ABV at all, so take it easy!

**Austrian Doppelbock 14.00% ABV**
