If there's one category that everyone seems to not be able to get enough of, it's Japanese Whisky.  I wish I could stock more in the bar, but the truth is that there just isn't that much out there available on the US market.  Just a handful of offerings from arch-rivals Suntory and Nikka, and once you cut out the priciest offerings, there are likely only 4-5 expressions to choose from. Venture outside of the two mega-players, and pricing and scarcity become a real issue.

Unlike their blended Scotch forebearers, Japanese Whiskies are unique in that there is no open trade in barrels between the distilleries.  Instead, each distillery makes many different expressions so as to provide base blending materials.  They'll try all kinds of wood, different ages, different recipes.  The result is some of the most consistently complex whiskies available.  Heavy peating is pretty atypical, so more often you'll run into nice rounded soft expressions.  Moreover, these whiskies are great at taking on water, as they are very much designed to lengthen rather than break.

Don't believe me?  Just check out this video to see just how serious the Japanese are about Whisky and Water:

The Mizuwari is just whisky and water...but it's one with very specific recipes depending on the base whisky and the bartender.

On a somewhat more doable level, I highly recommend you try the Nikka Coffey Grain Whisky with some coconut water (Harmless Harvest or similar, otherwise it can taste "cooked").  Totally refreshing while still true to the spirit itself.

###Suntory The Hakushu 12 Year Old

Lightly peated, this whisky is from Suntory's "Forest Distillery" roughly 100 miles west of Tokyo. The light and fruity style of the whisky is quite similar to the Yamazaki 12, but the smoke really makes up for the lack of richness. Compare it to offerings from Talisker.

On the nose, this one is orange peel, baked apple and green plum.  With a bit of water, I get fresh strawberry.  In the mouth it's got sweet smoke and is mouthfilling.  The finish blooms slowly and is mildly bitter.

**43% ABV**

###Nikka Taketsuru 12 Year Old

A number of single malts at least 12 years old are blended from both the Yoichi and Miyagikyo distilleries. It's a great entry point into Japanese Whisky if you've never had one before...and a great go-to drink even if you'd had plenty.

Lacquer, grapefruit, deeper malt, lychee, caramel and lime on the nose.  Char, graphite, black tea, peach, ceylon cinnamon in the mouth.

**40% ABV**

###Nikka Coffey Grain Whisky

This is Nikka's grain whisky (vs. barley malt) made on a continuous still.  Often the backbone of blended Scotch, you don't get too many opportunities to taste the distilled grain on its own.  Like Bourbon, this one is mostly corn, but you'd be hard pressed to find any other similarities between them.

Aromas of coconut, peach, acetone, brown bread, sugar plum and the beach.  With a bit of water, menthol comes out.   A bit of match head in the mouth, almost rum-like with a steely finish. Mixes exceptionally well with Harmless Harvest Coconut water.

**45% ABV**
