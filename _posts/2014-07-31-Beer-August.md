And just like that, we've switched things up.  The Coronado is the only IPA on tap, and that sweet sweet Samichlaus is also there.  With the two new additions, we now have both the heaviest (Samichlaus) and the lightest (Bikini) beers that we've ever had on tap all at the same time.  Don't say that I don't give you a good range!

###Hitachino Classic Pale Ale
Even though the Hitachino Nest beer only dates to 1996, Kiuchi brewery, who makes the beer has been brewing sake for 190 years.  They probably know a thing or two about fermented beverages.  The classic pale ale is brewed according to an 1862 spec, supposedly, it's the oldest known japanese beer recipe.

This beer hits you up front with cedar and spice with a background of lemon peel. On the tongue, it's lots of sweet malt and caramel.  It's got a medium long finish and mid-level bitterness.  Let this one warm up to cellar temps and it opens up for you. Next to the Samichlaus, this is the most substantial of the beers on tap.  Delicious stuff.

###EvilTwin Bikini Beer
Jeppe Jarnit-Bjergs√∏ began his brewery in Denmark, but in 2012 relocated to Brooklyn. He has also created beers for noma, The Aviary, and Pok Pok. This flying beermaker contract brews the bikini beer at Two Roads Brewing in Connecticut.  Their more "typical" portfolio if you could call it that, is one of much more substantial and often varied expressions.  For this beer however, it seems like they wanted to prove that you could make a light beer...but with plenty of flavor. It's named both after the atoll as well as the clothing item.  Make of that what you will.


The Bikini Beer is all hops, grapefruit and pine on the nose.  Super light in the mouth, green, and piney. It's got a long, lightly bitter finish.  Interesting combo of hop-driven flavor on top of a really light canvas.  Drink up!


**American PA 2.70% ABV**
