#{{ page.title }}

  

Brought in some new items strictly for the lounge.  Been so excited about them that I haven't even had a chance to taste them yet... Expect that to change soon though!  So, why am I posting without tasting notes?  Well, they're just too fun to keep to myself.

###White Oak Akashi Grain & Single Malt

Yes, we do certainly have a love for Japanese Whisky, and here are the two newest to be imported to the US.  And, to my knowledge this is only the 4th Japanese Whisky family to make it over.  I'm calling it a "family" as there are the two big companies, Suntory and Nikka, plus Chichibu, and now, Eigashima.  Oddly enough, Eigashima has been making "Whisky" in Japan since 1919.  For you Japanese Whisky buffs out there, this pre-dates proper Japanese Whisky making by Masataka Taketsuru.  In fact, Eigashima's distillery license pre-dates Yamazaki by about 4 years.  However, I put Whisky in quotes back there because prior to Taketsuru, Japanese Whisky produced domestically was more often than not a mixture of neutral spirits, artificial flavorings, sugar, spices and who knows what else.

So while they've had their distillery license for ages, Eigashima's proper whisky operation didn't actually begin until the late 90's early 2000s.  So while their involvement in the whisky business goes all the way back to the begining, the production of Japanese Whisky is very much a recent project.  What's more, the distillery's focus is actually on Sake and Sochu, so they only produce whisky a whole 2 months out of the year.  What that translates to is...this stuff will be pretty limited.

###Bruichladdich Islay Barley, Rockside Farm 2007

This is the first of what I hope will be quite a few interesting bottles from Jim McEwan and Bruichladdich.  Their intention with this expression is to give you a real taste of the local barley and the terroir.  As such, it is unpeated and aged in Oak.  All of the barley for this Single Malt comes from their neighbors Mark and Rohaise French.  My hope is that with this bottle, you get a sense of the juice itself, rather than the typically dominant character of barrel aging which defines many other spirits.

###Rhum JM Blanc

Continuing with the theme of "the taste of the juice," this is a white agricole rum distilled directly from sugar cane juice rather than molasses.  Maybe only 5% of the world's rums are produced this way. And even more so, Rhum JM seeks to represent a unique terroir with the sugar cane grown on a volcanic slope in Martinique.  Most sugarcane is grown on flat lands on relatively utilitarian soil, but JM firmly believes in its own unique micro-climate.  The rhum sees no wood, but is rested in stainless steel tanks before bottling.  This is definitely a spirit that is more grown than made.

###Willett 2 Year Old Rye

So, why is a 2 year old Rye in the Lounge, while we have the 4 Year Old in the Main Bar?  Well, the answer goes back a bit...about 30 years.  The Willett name has a long and storied history in American Whiskey starting from the beginings of Bourbon, however, what we know of Willett these days only goes as far as 1984 when Even Kulsveen, having married into the Willett family, purchased the business and the shuttered family distillery.  For the past three decades, the Kulsveens have been restoring the distillery while bottling whisky distilled elsewhere, most notably LDI in Indiana.

This bottle represents the first release of juice actually distilled at the Willet family distillery in Bardstown, Kentucky.  It is the product of 30 years of Even's labor and is the work of his son, Drew, the Master Distiller...needless to say, it's a pretty special moment in the history of American Whiskey.  I've got a bottle at home for myself, and I'll likely grab a few more soon!
