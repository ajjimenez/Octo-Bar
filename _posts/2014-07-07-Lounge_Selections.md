#{{ page.title }}

  

Brought in some new items strictly for the lounge.  Been so excited about them that I haven't even had a chance to taste them yet. Expect that to change soon though!  So, why am I posting without tasting notes?  Well, they're just too fun to keep to myself.

###White Oak Akashi Grain & Single Malt

Yes, we do certainly have a love for Japanese Whisky over here, and here are the two newest to be imported to the US.  And, to my knowledge this is only the 4th Japanese Whisky family to be imported.  I'm calling it a "family" as there are the two big companies, Suntory and Nikka, plus Chichibu, and now, Eigashima.  Oddly enough, Eigashima has been making "Whisky" in Japan since 1919.  For you Japanese Whisky Buffs out there, this pre-dates Masataka Taketsuru's return from Scotland which would eventually give rise to both Suntory and Nikka.  I put Whisky in quotes back there because prior to Taketsuru, Japanese Whisky produced domestically was more often than not a mixture of neutral spirits, artificial flavorings, sugar, spices and who knows what else.

In any case, Eigashima's proper whisky operation didn't actually begin until the early 2000s.  So while their involvement in the whisky business goes all the way back to the begining, their production of Japanese Whisky is very much a recent project.  What's more, the distillery's focus is actually on Sake and Sochu, so they only actually produce whisky a whole 2 months out of the year.  So guess what...this stuff will be pretty limited.

###Bruichladdich Islay Barley, Rockside Farm 2007

This is the first of what I hope will be quite a few interesting bottles from Jim McEwan and Bruichladdich.  Their intention with this expression is to give you a real taste of the local barley and the terroir.  As such, it is unpeated and aged in Oak.  All of the barley for this Single Malt comes from their neighbors Mark and Rohaise French.  My hope is that with this bottle, you get a sense of the juice itself, rather than the typically dominant character of barrel aging which defines many other spirits.

###Rhum JM Blanc

Continuing with the theme of "the taste of the Juice," this is a white agricole rum distilled directly from sugar cane juice rather than molasses.  Perhaps only 5% of the worlds rums are produced this way, and even more so, Rhum JM seeks to represent a unique terroir, as the sugar cane is grown on a volcanic slope in Martinique.  Most sugarcane is grown on flat lands on relatively utilitarian soil.  The rhum sees no wood, but is rested in stainless steel tanks before bottling.  This is definitely a spirit that is more grown than made.

###Willett 2 Year Old Rye

So, why is a 2 year old Rye in the Lounge, while we have the 4 Year Old in the Main Bar?  Well, it's actually kind of a long story...about 30 years long.  The Willett name has a long and storied history in American Whiskey going back to the very begining, however, what we know of Willett these days goes as far as 1984 when Even Kulsveen, having married into the Willett family purchased the business and the shuttered family distillery.  For the past three decades, the Kulsveens have been restoring the distillery while bottling whisky distilled elsewhere, most notably LDI in Indiana.

This bottle represents the first release of juice actually distilled at the Willet family distillery in Bardstown, Kentucky.  It is the product of 30 years of Even's labor and is the work of his son, Drew, the Master Distiller...needless to say, it's a pretty special moment in the history of American Whiskey.  I've got a bottle at home for myself, and I'll likely grab a few more soon!
