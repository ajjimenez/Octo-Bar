American Whiskeys are definitely the core of the bar here, so I decided to take a fresh look at how we keep it stocked.  These five Bourbons and one Rye all make for great sippers as well as bases for cocktails.

###Evan Williams "White Label"

Classic bourbon, toasted wood, acetone, soft paper, cork, yellow cake, laquer on the nose.  On the sip, fresh apple skins, rose, candied lemon peel

###Four Roses "Yellow Label"

Sweeter than Evan Williams, more fruit, lychee, prune on the nose. Tastes soft, more floral.

###Bulleit Bourbon

marshmallow, sugar, char, ember in the hand, incense.  hard candy, lavender on the tongue

###Maker's Mark Whisky

stone fruit, heat, brandy-like, clean, rasin, sawdust, fresh green grapes on the nose. light, savory, green stick, likes water, ripe stone fruit on the tongue

###Elijah Craig 12 Year Old
white sugar, tropical fruit, coffee, heat, grape stem, syrup. sweet heat, rasin, apricot, hard candy on the tongue.
