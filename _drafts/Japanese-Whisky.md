If there's one category that everyone seems to not be able to get enough of, it's Japanese Whisky.  I wish I could stock more in the bar, but the truth is that there just isn't that much out there available on the US market.  Just a handful of offerings from archrivals Suntory and Nikka, and once you cut out the priciest offerings, there are likely only 4-5 expressions to choose from.  

Venture outside of the two mega-players, and pricing and scarcity become a real issue.  I do have a botte of Chichibu at home...so maybe you can sweet talk me in to trying some one day.

Unlike their Scotch forebearers, Japanese Whiskies are unique in that there is no open trade in barrells between the distilleries.  Instead, each distillery makes many different expressions so as to provide base blending materials.  They'll try all kinds of wood, different ages, different recipes
